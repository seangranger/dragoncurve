This fractal can be considered the result of and is indeed generated by simply folding a piece of paper in half.
# Algo:
Upon first examination each subsequent iteration appears to produce a random sequence of folds but if you imagine the folds as sequences of 'up' & 'down', each iteration adds a fold between each existing fold. The folds that you add alternate between 'up' and 'down.
